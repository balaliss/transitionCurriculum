# Transitioning Web Developers Curriculum

## Overview

This curriculum is specifically designed to bridge the knowledge gap between web development instruction received in a facility (such as a prison or other controlled environments) and the instruction offered in community-based coding BootCamps. 

### The Problem

In many facility-based educational programs, students learn programming without access to the Internet or other resources that are readily available to students in the "real world." While these programs often do an excellent job of teaching foundational skills—such as HTML, CSS, and basic programming concepts—students may leave these programs with gaps in their knowledge. These gaps are primarily due to the lack of exposure to modern development practices, tools, and the fast-paced, collaborative environment of the tech industry.

Without addressing these gaps, students transitioning from facility-based programs to community BootCamps may struggle to keep up with their peers, leading to frustration and potentially hindering their progress. 

### The Solution

This curriculum exists to assess students' abilities and close any learning gaps that might have been missed during their time in a facility-based program. It focuses on advancing the skills they've already acquired, introducing them to modern development practices, tools, and workflows that are crucial for success in the tech industry.

### Curriculum Focus

- **Advanced HTML, CSS, and Responsive Design**: While students may already be familiar with HTML and CSS, this curriculum dives deeper into advanced techniques, ensuring they can create responsive and accessible web applications.
  
- **JavaScript Deep Dive**: JavaScript is essential for modern web development. This curriculum emphasizes not just the basics but also advanced JavaScript concepts, including ES6+ features, asynchronous programming, and an introduction to popular frameworks like React or Vue.js.
  
- **Version Control with Git and GitHub**: Understanding version control is critical for any developer. This curriculum ensures students are proficient with Git and GitHub, focusing on collaborative workflows, which are a staple in the tech industry.
  
- **Backend Development Basics**: To prepare students for full-stack development, this curriculum introduces them to server-side programming with Node.js, RESTful API design, and database integration.
  
- **Full-Stack Project**: Students will apply all their skills by building and deploying a full-stack application, providing them with a comprehensive understanding of the development process from start to finish.
  
- **Soft Skills and Career Preparation**: Technical skills alone are not enough. This curriculum also emphasizes the importance of soft skills, such as effective communication, teamwork, and career readiness, including resume building and interview preparation.
  
- **Continuous Learning and Adaptation**: The tech industry evolves rapidly. This curriculum encourages a mindset of continuous learning, helping students stay current with new technologies and industry trends.

### Objectives

1. **Assess Students' Abilities**: Through assessments and project-based activities, the curriculum identifies any gaps in students' knowledge and provides targeted learning opportunities to close those gaps.
   
2. **Prepare for Real-World Challenges**: By focusing on advanced concepts and real-world tools, the curriculum ensures that students are not just proficient in web development but are also prepared to thrive in a professional environment.
   
3. **Support the Transition**: This curriculum serves as a bridge, helping students transition smoothly from a highly structured, resource-limited environment to a dynamic, collaborative learning space.
